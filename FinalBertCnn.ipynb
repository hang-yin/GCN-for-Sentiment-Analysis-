for creating a movie that not only has a beautifully stylish look to it cinematography wise has great acting <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> a haunting soundtrack by <UNK> and a very dream like quality to it but on

make sense of the movie by expecting traditional methods in which the story is laid out in a <UNK> logic and linear manner for the viewer but for those expecting that i urge you to check the name of the director and come back again br br <UNK> is the story of the sad demise of diane <UNK> a wannabe actor who is hopelessly in love with another actor <UNK> due to <UNK> lack of talent she is constantly struggling to advance her career and feels she failed to deliver on her own and her parents' expectations upon realizing that <UNK> will never be hers c becomes engaged with adam the director she hires a <UNK> to get rid of her and subsequently has to deal with the guilt that it produces br br the movie first starts off with what may seem as a strange opening for this kind of thriller which is some 50s dance <UNK> contest in which we can see the main character betty giving a great performance we also see an elderly couple which we will see twice more throughout the movie together with her and <UNK> her br br no wait this is what most people see the first time they view it there's actually another very significant fact that is given before the credits the camera moving into an object although <UNK> and the scene quickly <UNK> out if you look closely the object is actually a <UNK> revealing that what follows is a dream br br the main characters seen in the first half of the movie br br betty diane imaginary self used in the first half of the movie that <UNK> the dream sequence a positive portrayal of a successful aspiring young actor the complete opposite of diane was chosen as the name as that is the real name of the waitress at notice that in the dream version the name is br br rita the fantasy version of <UNK> <UNK> that through <UNK> dream and with the help of an imaginary car accident is turned into an <UNK> this makes her vulnerable and <UNK> on <UNK> love she is then conveniently placed in betty <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> home which betty has been allowed to stay in br br <UNK> in real life <UNK> mother in the dream part the woman in charge of the apartment complex that betty stays in she's mainly a strong authority figure as can be witnessed in both parts of the film br br adam the director we know from the second half that he gets engaged with <UNK> his sole purpose for being in the first half of the movie is only to serve as a <UNK> bag for betty diane since she develops such hatred towards him br br aunt ruth <UNK> real aunt but instead of being out of town she is actually dead diane inherited the money left by her aunt and used that to pay for murder br br mr roach a typical <UNK> character not real appears only in <UNK> dream sequence he's a mysterious influential person that controls the chain of events in the dream from his wheelchair he serves much of the same function as the backwards talking dwarf which he also plays in twin peaks br br the <UNK> the person that murders <UNK> this character is basically the same in both parts of the movie although rendered in a slightly more goofy fashion in the dream sequence more on that below br br now having established the various versions of the characters in the movie we can begin to delve into the plot of course i will not go into every little detail neither will i lay it out <UNK> but i will try to explain some of the important scenes in relation to hint sheet br br as i mentioned above <UNK> was re produced as an <UNK> through her improbable survival of a car accident in the first 10 minutes of the movie which left her completely vulnerable what i found very intriguing with <UNK> is that lynch constantly gives hints on what is real and what isn't i've already mentioned the camera moving into the <UNK> but notice how there's two cars riding in each lane approaching the <UNK> br br only one of the cars actually hit the <UNK> what about the other even if they stayed clear of the accident themselves wouldn't they try to help the others or at least call for help my theory is that since this is a dream the presence of the other car is just set aside and forgotten about since as ebert so <UNK> puts it like real dreams it does not explain does not complete its sequences <UNK> over what it finds fascinating <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> br br shortly after rita <UNK> down from the crash site at <UNK> dr and makes her way down the <UNK> and <UNK> into aunt <UNK> apartment betty arrives and we see this creepy old couple driving away staring <UNK> at each other and <UNK> at themselves and the camera this is the first indication that what we're seeing is a nightmare br br although the old couple seem to be unfamiliar to betty i think they're actually her parents since they were <UNK> her at the <UNK> contest perhaps she didn't know them all that well and didn't really have as good a relationship with them as she wanted so the couple is shown as very pleasant and helpful to her in the dream they also represent her feelings of guilt from the murder and <UNK> sense of <UNK> regarding her <UNK> goals in her life br br a rather long and hilarious scene is the one involving the <UNK> diane apparently sees him as the major force behind the campaign trying to pressure the director to accept part in the movie from <UNK> party in the second half of the movie and he therefore <UNK> a major part of her dream because of her feelings of guilt and <UNK> towards the murder of <UNK> a part of her wants him to miss so she turns him into a dumb criminal br br this scene i think is also lynch's attempt at totally <UNK> his audience over since they're given a false <UNK> in which to view the movie br br gotta love that <UNK> just bit me <UNK> line though br br the next interesting scene is the one with the two persons at <UNK> who are having a conversation about how one of them keep having this recurring nightmare involving a man which is seen by him through a wall outside of the diner that they're sitting in after a little talk they head outside and keep walking toward the corner of a fence accompanied of course by excellent music matching the mood of the scene br br when reaching the corner a bum like character with a <UNK> face appears out from behind the corner <UNK> the living crap out of the man having the nightmare this nightmare exists only in <UNK> mind she saw that guy in the diner when paying for the murder so in short her translate into that poor guy's nightmares the bum also <UNK> <UNK> evil side as can be witnessed later in the movie br br the cowboy <UNK> along with the dwarf one of the strange characters that are always present in the <UNK> landscape diane only saw him for a short while at <UNK> party but just like our own dreams can award insignificant persons that we hardly know a major part in our dreams so can he be awarded an important part in her dream we are also given further clues during his scenes that what we're seeing is not real his sudden disappearance etc br br the cowboy is also used as a tool to mock the director when he meets up with him at the odd location the lights here give a clear indication that this is part of a dream also notice how he says that he will appear one more time if he adam does good or two more times if he does bad throughout the movie he appears two more times <UNK> to diane that she did bad he is also the one to wake her up to reality that scene is probably an illusion made to fit into her <UNK> of him appearing twice and shortly thereafter she commits suicide br br the <UNK> scene with the brothers where we can see <UNK> the composer as <UNK> is probably a result of the fact that diane was having an <UNK> just before <UNK> and adam made their <UNK> at <UNK> party in the second half it could at the same time also be a statement from lynch br br during the scene in which they enter <UNK> apartment the body lying in the bed is <UNK> but notice how she's assumed <UNK> sleeping position diane is seeing herself in her own dream but the face is not hers although it had the same wounds on the face as diane would have after shooting herself this scene is also filled with some genuine <UNK> creepiness since diane did not know where or when the <UNK> would get to <UNK> and finish her off she just put her into her own home br br in real life <UNK> audition for the movie part was bad in her dream she delivers a perfect audition leaving the whole crew <UNK> about her performance br br also interesting is the fact that the money that in real life was used to pay for murder now appears in rita purse this is part of <UNK> <UNK> of her terrible act by effectively being given the money back as the murder now hasn't taken place br br when her neighbor arrives to get her piano shaped <UNK> another hint is given she takes the <UNK> from her table and leaves yet later when <UNK> and betty have their encounter on the couch we see the <UNK> appear again when the camera pans over the table suggesting that <UNK> encounter with the neighbor was a fantasy br br the catch phrase of the movie adam is <UNK> actresses for is she is the girl which are the exact same words that diane uses when giving the <UNK> photo resume br br the blue box and the key represent the major turning point in the movie and is where the true identities of the characters are revealed there's much symbolism going on here the box may represent <UNK>
